# Proof of Concept: Using Machine Learning to Improve Service Provision

## Overview  
This repository contains a proof of concept developed by **Nextwave Education Solutions** to explore how **machine learning techniques** can be applied to improve service provision for international student advising.  

The study demonstrates how **unsupervised learning (clustering)** can be used to segment students based on their academic readiness, financial capacity, and logistical preparednessâ€”allowing for **personalized guidance, efficient targeting, and smarter resource allocation** across student support services.

## Introduction  
As global demand for quality education rises, many students from countries such as **Kenya, Tanzania, and Pakistan** are actively seeking opportunities to pursue higher education abroad, particularly in destinations like **Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom**.  

However, navigating this journey is complex. Each student faces unique challenges related to academic readiness, financial capacity, logistical constraints, and program preferences.

At **Nextwave Education Solutions**, our mission is to help students from underrepresented regions access life-changing international education opportunities. To do this effectively at scale, we must go beyond traditional advising approaches and adopt **data-driven methods** that allow us to personalize guidance, target services efficiently, and match students to universities where they are most likely to thrive.

This proof of concept demonstrates how **machine learning clustering** can help identify and group students based on shared characteristics from consultation surveys, enabling targeted outreach and tailored advising strategies.
